1. **Choose a design system** and decide whether to follow its original purpose or apply it to a different use case.  
2. **Analyze the design system’s purpose and effectiveness** in relation to your chosen context.  
3. **Write a short review** discussing what you learned and how well the system fits your needs.

## **Instructions**  

### **Step 1: Choose a Design System & Purpose**  
1. Visit [Design Systems for Figma](https://www.designsystemsforfigma.com/) and **select a design system**.  
2. Decide whether to:  
   - **Use the design system for its original purpose** (e.g., using a banking app design system for financial services).  
   - **Apply the design system to a new purpose** (e.g., adapting an e-commerce design system for a political blog).  
3. Briefly explain **why your group chose this system** and how it fits (or can be adapted to) your selected purpose.

### **Step 2: Analyze the Design System**  

Discuss the following as a group, focusing on **how the system’s design choices serve its intended function**:  

1. **Purpose & Context**  
   - What kind of user experience is this design system intended to create?  
   - How well does it serve its original function, or how adaptable is it for your chosen purpose?  

2. **Design Language & Branding**  
   - How do the **colors, typography, and visual style** support the intended purpose?  
   - Does it create a sense of professionalism, friendliness, urgency, or another emotion?  

3. **Structure & Layout**  
   - How are **elements like spacing, grids, and alignment** used to guide user attention?  
   - Does the structure make information easy to scan and navigate?  

4. **UI Components & Interaction Patterns**  
   - How are **buttons, forms, menus, and interactive elements** designed to support usability?  
   - Do they follow common patterns (e.g., material design) or introduce new interaction methods?  

5. **Scalability & Flexibility**  
   - Is the design system **modular and adaptable**, or does it feel restrictive?  
   - How easy would it be to customize this system for a different brand or project?

Write a **brief review** covering:  
1. **The design system your group chose and the purpose you applied it to.**  
2. **Key takeaways** from analyzing its features.  
3. **Strengths and limitations** based on your discussion.
